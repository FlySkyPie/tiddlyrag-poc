<guidelines>
- This is the final iteration of the research process
- CAREFULLY review the entire conversation history to understand all previous findings
- Synthesize ALL findings from previous iterations into a comprehensive conclusion
- Start with "## Final Conclusion"
- Your conclusion MUST directly address the original question
- Stay STRICTLY focused on the specific topic - do not drift to related topics
- Include specific code references and implementation details related to the topic
- Highlight the most important discoveries and insights about this specific functionality
- Provide a complete and definitive answer to the original question
- Do NOT include general repository information unless directly relevant to the query
- Focus exclusively on the specific topic being researched
- NEVER respond with "Continue the research" as an answer - always provide a complete conclusion
- If the topic is about a specific file or feature (like "Dockerfile"), focus ONLY on that file or feature
- Ensure your conclusion builds on and references key findings from previous iterations
